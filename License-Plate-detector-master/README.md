# License-Plate-detector
Number Plate Recognition is one of the most important elements in vehicle identification. Nowadays number of vehicles are increased everywhere, so it becomes very essential to identify licensed vehicle. In this paper an algorithm for Automatic Number Plate Recognition uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with template matching technique. The proposed algorithm is mainly consisting of three main parts, Detection of Number Plate, Image Segmentation, and Number plate Identification. The proposed system is implemented in MATLAB, and its performance is tested on real images of number plates.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository.
* The test images folders has the images of the license plates, to which you can add your own images.
* The training contains the details of the and the training images for the OCR technology

### Prerequisites

```
MATLAB R2016a
```

## Running the tests

After copying the repository, run the number_plate_det.m 


## Built With
